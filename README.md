# SeaBattleBot

I'm trying to develop an AI for this other project of mine 
https://github.com/AntonC9018/SeaBattle-2 
but approach it the ML way instead of the traditional, algorithmical one.

It's my very first attempt at coding Neural Networks so I decided to code one from scratch, 
using high level tensorflow API as little as possible so that I understand the math behind this better.
